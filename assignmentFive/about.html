<h2>Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h2>
<hr />
</br>

<h3>Portfolio</h3>
<p>It would be helpful for my professional career to have a space to store the work I have done. I want a place to link the asset I created as well as any associated metrics</p>
</br>

<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>My good friend is an incredible photographer. I would love to create a website to help highlight her work.</p>
</br>

<h3>Small Business</h3>
<p>While I don't have an idea for a small business, I think I have the possibility of starting one in the future. It would be helpful to design one in case I want one in the future.</p>
