FAQs:
    Q: What type of pods should I get?
    A: You should check what type of Nespresso you have (either Vertuo or Original). You need to order the type of pod that correlates with your machine. For a latte, order either Double Espresso or Ristretto & Espresso pods.

    Q: Where can I get coffee syrups?
    A: You can order them online from Amazon for a wide selection of flavors. You can also find options in Walmarts or Wincos. Be sure to check if your town has a Chef Store that has more options!
