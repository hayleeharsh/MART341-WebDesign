# Assignment 3

## Haylee Harshbarger

### Web Design

So far, this course has been a reminder on what I learned in Creative Coding. However, it goes into more detail. The rest of my classes are going well.

**What I am eager to learn about:**

- How to add aesthetic elements to a webpage beyond just coding titles and shapes
- Visual communication

*There is nothing I need right now for you to support me directly*
