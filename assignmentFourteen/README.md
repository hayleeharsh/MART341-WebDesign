1. 3+ pages - yes
2. Framework integration - Bootstrap on White Wine - TEST
3. Framework styling elements - Attempted on white wine page. For some reason, I cannot get the same styling on this page. I worked on this for hours but couldn't get it figured out. Why isn't the background and the nav styling applying? I feel like my code has gotten too in the weeds on this page. 
4. HTML5 Canvas - Used a Canvas for the Wine of the Month
5. JavaScript functionality - Wine of the Month Page
